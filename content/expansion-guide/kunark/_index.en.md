Kunark introduces the first expansion ever released to EverQuest. In The Heroes Journey, here's a list of things worth noting about Kunark that are unique to other servers:

- No new AAs are introduced in Kunark
- No keys are required for Howling Stones (charasis) or Sebilis
- To Access Veeshan's Peak, you must kill the 4 dragons of Kunark
- Veeshan's Peak is 1.0 version, making it in line with Kunark era loot
- Legacy of Ykesha zones are unlocked with Kunark, as well as Stonebrunt Mountains and Jaggedpine Forest.
- Legacy of Ykesha gear was reduced to put it more in line with Kunark era loot
