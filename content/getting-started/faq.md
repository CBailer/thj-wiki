## FAQ

> [!question]
> Can I reroll my classes if I dont like them?

Not right now. Eventually rerolling for EoM might be a thing, but currently it is not.


> [!question]
> Some of my skills arent trainable, but still show up in the GM list with no level restriction?

One of two things is happening. You are at the wrong GM (It needs to be the GM for the class that owns the skill) or its dual wield, and that is being worked on. Dual wield will not work until the intended level, even if you can equip more than one weapon.


> [!question]
> I have X problem, and I need Cata/Aporia to look at it?

Do not ping them unless its game breaking, submit a bug-report in the discord.


> [!question]
> Why cant I find items that dropped on Retribution or Pyrelight dropping at the same %?

The loot tables are based off of Project EQ right now, not specific to either of the other servers.


> [!question]
> How long will this test last? Will there be a wipe?

This test will continue for an unknown period of time, with an increasing number of invites going out, culminating in open testing. When it is ready, there will be a full character wipe prior to going public.


> [!question]
> Will there be anymore wipes during the Alpha/Beta developement?

Yes, there will be a wipe before open beta, and another wipe before "Official Launch"
