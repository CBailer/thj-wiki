## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

{{<button href="https://heroesjourneyeq.com/download/thj-client.zip">}}DOWNLOAD THJ CLIENT HERE{{</button>}}

To start The Heroes Journey (THJ):


  * You will first need an [EQ Emulator account](http://www.eqemulator.org/)

  * Once that is complete, [create a login server account](http://www.eqemulator.org/account/?CreateLS)

  * If you haven't already, [download the THJpatcher.zip](https://heroesjourneyeq.com/download/thj-client.zip) (you may need to click on the file and tell Windows it is safe by clicking the arrow on the download and selecting "Keep")

  * Right click the zipped download, go to properties, and check Unblock in the lower right. Then click OK.  Then extract the files to wherever you want EQ to be installed. Do not run the patcher in the same folder as another PEQ server install unless you are done playing on that server.

  * After extraction, find and run heroesjourneyeq.exe. This is the file you will run to patch and play.

  * Click "Patch" if it is Red (THIS MAY TAKE SOME TIME)

  * Click "Play" once the patch has finished or if patch is Grey (it will say Complete! Press Play to begin).
